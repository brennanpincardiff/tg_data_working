According to police she had just been dropped off by a car near Hunting Park when the men surrounded her and beat her. When she fell to the ground, one of the attackers pulled out a gun and shot her in the back twice. She died in hospital.

Pedro Redding, 22, of Hunting Park, was subsequently arrested for robbery and murder.  Redding reportedly admits to beating her but insists that someone else fired the gun.

> Keisha was a Philadelphia native who previously attended West Philadelphia High School and was attending Temple University at the time of her death.
> 
> Friends and family described her as warm, jolly and “comfortable” in her own skin. She’s remembered for lovingly caring for her grandmother during her battle with cancer, by keeping grandma’s fridge stocked and being there for her during her “weakest moments.” Kiesha’s family can’t understand why anyone would want to kill her.

She had been stabbed 13 times.

Her killing sparked an outcry from the country’s trans community – who face an extremely high murder rate.

> Sacayán was well respected in her home country for her work with LGBT rights group Movimento Antidiscriminatorio de Liberación and role as an alternate representative of the Trans Secretariat on the Board of ILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association).
> 
> In 2012 she was one of the first transgender citizens to change their legal gender and was issued legal papers directly by Argentina’s president Cristina Kirchner.

In June 2018 her killer, Gabriel David Marino, 25, was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Buenos Aires criminal court. Marino was the first person in the country to be found guilty under a law that targets gender and hate violence against transgender people.

> When she was checked at 7pm, Vikki was seen lying on her bed, giving no cause for concern, the inquest heard.
> 
> But at a later check at 8.10pm she could not be seen - so staff went into her cell.
> 
> Emergency services were called and she was pronounced dead 38 minutes later. A post-mortem examination found the cause of death was thought to be hanging.

Vikki had previously said she would kill herself if she was sent to a male prison. An inquest heard that she was considered to be ""at risk of self-harm"".

> The Ministry of Justice has been called “at best incompetent and at worst inhumane” after the “deeply tragic” death of a young transgender woman who was sent to a men’s jail.
> 
> ""This was a death waiting to happen...There was no consideration of the gender she had openly identified with for half her life"".

Philip Goldberg, the lawyer for Ms Thompson’s family, also strongly criticised HMP Leeds. 

> “Vikki’s case is a deeply tragic one,” Mr Goldberg said. “She is one of three transgender women to die within the male prison estate since November 2015. Yes, Vikki was a transgender woman housed in a male prison but like many others in prison her vulnerability did not make her unique. It was the responsibility of HMP Leeds to ensure she was properly looked after and safe.
> 
> “The jury heard that Vikki experienced bullying and sexual harassment on E-Wing that caused her to self-harm before she was moved to the Vulnerable Prisoner’s wing. HMP Leeds has the second-highest number of self-inflicted deaths in the UK and an inability to learn from their mistakes. Vikki’s mother remains deeply distressed by the loss of her daughter. Yet hopes that if any good is to come of her death, it’s that the Ministry of Justice also undertakes a complete overhaul of HMP Leeds.”
> 
> He added that “a radical shift in prison staff culture and training was needed to protect transgender prisoners.”

Just a month before Vikki's death, trans campaigners had successfully managed to get Tara Hudson moved from HMP Bristol - another male prison - to a female institution after a demonstration outside the Ministry of Justice presented a petition with over 159,000 signatures.

A month later Joanne Latham was found dead in a male prison at HMP Woodhill, Milton Keynes.

Yoshi Tsuchida,38,NA,2015_11_13_Yoshi-Tsuchida.jpg,https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/11/18/japanese-trans-man-brutally-maimed-and-murdered-tokyo,2015-11-13,13 Nov 2015/Yoshi Tsuchida,Tokyo,Japan,35.680071,139.768522,suffocated,"Yoshi was found at his home in Fussa City by his adopted son, dead, mutilated and draped in a blanket, with his head covered in a plastic bag, and ""his face skinned off by a knife.""

Although initially thought to be a homicide the following month the results of a pathology examination revealed the cause of death to be medicinal poisoning following the intake of large quantities of the drug Etizolam, which is often used as a sleeping pill. Reportedly the Metropolitan Police concluded that Yoshi's face was eaten by his pet dogs after he committed suicide.

> Tsuchida’s brutal murder illuminates the global reach of violence against transgender individuals, along with the gruesome propensity for excessively violent ends to such transphobic attacks. But the homicide also sheds light on continuing problems in the reportage of such crimes within both English and Japanese language sources. 
> 
> Both The Japan Times, a politically moderate English-language source, and Sankei Shimbun, a politically conservative Japanese-language source, misgendered Tsuchida and his daughter repeatedly. 
> 
> Jiji Press, another Japanese source that reported the crime, is known for its sensationalistic reporting on transgender individuals. A story published Monday sought to expose the supposed “secrets and surgery” of gender-affirming medical procedures in China. 
> 
> In reporting on Tsuchida’s death, all of the aforementioned publications called his process of clinical and social transition a “sex change.”

Hers was the second reported LGBTI murder in the area in a month.

At around midday on 27th December at around midday Phoebe went with a neighbour’s child to an informal shop in the town of Wolseley to buy iced lollies.

According to reports received by LGBTI rights group Triangle Project while there she accidentally stepped on the toes of a 15-year-old boy at the store. The furious youth responded by allegedly shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs, including “vuil moffie” (dirty faggot) at her.

After being repeatedly verbally abused by the teen, Titus told a friend’s mother across the road from the shop that she was “sick of being called names.” Annoyed, the woman picked up a plastic crate and gestured with it to the youth.

It’s alleged that a man in his twenties near the shop then handed a knife to the boy, who  plunged it into Phoebe’ neck.

Bleeding profusely, she staggered away, collapsing and dying about 500 metres down the road in a pool of blood.

> “I think she’d just had enough of being called names,” an emotional Sharon Cox, Triangle’s Health and Support Services Manager, told Mambaonline. “She was beautiful and was loved in the community. She was a hairdresser in Wolseley at the time of her death, and was a friend to many. Everybody knew her.”

Her body showed signs of trauma and foul play is suspected. Whether the police found the body in Sierra's home or a neighbour's house is not known.

Her friends said they had no idea she was killed until weeks later because her birth name was published in the media.
 
> With details scant about Sierra’s death, transgender advocates like Jeriann Guzman, the executive director of the Solano Serenity Center and Kelli Busey, editor-in-chief of Planet Transgender have sought to humanize Sierra and draw awareness about her death. The Solano Serenity Center was among the first to list Sierra on its website among trans homicide victims who must be remembered this year.
> 
> “Piecing together her life like a crossword puzzle we are learning a little about her,’” says Busey in her Planet Transgender report. ""There’s a Tumblr post where the author postulates a police conspiracy to cover up her murder which local media conspicuously called ‘suspicious.'""
> 
> The Tumblr post to which Busey refers alleges mishandling of the investigation by local police. While the author of the post remains unnamed, the individual’s allegations were repeated at the same time as the Tumblr post went live by two other trans people on Facebook (in comments now marked private) by individuals who claim to be friends of Sierra. (The author of the Tumblr post has not responded to a query by press time.)
> 
> The accusations on Tumblr and Facebook have yet to be verified because, for over a month, advocates say that Bakersfield police have not responded to queries. Advocates also note that the police’s apparent refusal to clarify the circumstances of the alleged homicide have exacerbated the transgender community’s frustration and fomented rampant speculation.

She died in hospital.

In November 2017 Rowell was convicted of her murder and sentenced in 20 years in prison.

> Rowell confessed to shooting Loera at the start of the trial, but his lawyers argued it was an act of self-defense. He allegedly believed Loera robbed him after he responded to her ad on backpage.com and visited her at her North Austin home in the early hours of Jan. 22, 2016. He told the jury that she threatened him with a bat when he came back with a loaded gun in search of his wallet, which was later found in his jacket pocket. Instead of leaving, he shot her from a foot away and fled. As Payan told the jury during closing arguments, “When you point a loaded gun at someone and shoot it at close range that’s an intentional act.”
> 
> Later that day he drove back to Childress, Texas, where his then-wife and 10-day-old son were living while he was working in Georgetown. Over the weekend he Googled numerous things, aside from how to get away with murder, including legal defense, porn, and backpage – once again looking for trans sex workers. “If he was so scared that he needed to use deadly force,” Payan asked rhetorically. “Why is he back at it the next day?”

She died in hospital shortly after midnight.

Tiffany E. Floyd, 25, and Jose Pena, 19, were arrested for her murder. Floyd was sentenced to 8-20 years in jail plus 10 years of probation for third-degree murder. Pena was sentanced to 40-80 years for the first-degree murder of Maya and the unrelated murder of Jonathan Martel. Both had stabbed Maya, but it was the second stabbing by Pena which ultimately killed her.

> Maya Young had a distinctive birthmark: One side of her face was light and the other dark, with a line down the middle separating the brown tones.
> 
> ""She looked like chocolate and caramel,"" said Anthony Harper, a longtime friend and former roommate of the 25-year-old transgender woman. He used to call her ""Twix,"" like the candy bar. ""She was sweet, like candy. She loved people and she loved being around people,"" he said.

After the pair were sentenced Maya's sister said:

> “It’s finally over. It can never bring her back or take away the pain but, at the end of the day, I feel like she can rest better now that justice was served in her favor”.

Maya was the third known transgender woman of color killed in Philadelphia over the course of a year, after Kiesha Jenkins 22, in October 2015, and London Kiki Chanel in May 2015.

He died at the scene.

Matthews turned himself in to local police on the day of the shooting and confessed to the killing.

Matthews originally told the police that he shot Stansberry by accident under the belief that his gun was empty after removing the clip on New Year’s Eve. However, local reports claim that Stansberry was shot at point-blank range with the shooter standing at his side.

He was charged with negligent homicide, illegal use of a weapon, and possession of a firearm by a felon.

> “We are saddened by the loss of Demarkis Stansberry, and send our condolences to his loved ones,” said Emily Waters of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in a statement. “We are only beginning to see national visibility around the disproportionate violence that transgender people face in this nation. Violence against transgender men has been largely missing from these conversations, and we must encourage a discussion of the unique ways that transgender men experience violence.”
> 
> Elizabeth Anne Jenkins, president of Louisiana Trans Advocates, on her Facebook page said that Stansberry was a member of her organisation.

Their body was found with a plastic garbage bag wrapped around their head and multiple gunshot wounds in an alley at around 11:30pm on 2nd March.

> On an unseasonably cold Wednesday evening last year, 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson stopped by a close friend’s house to try on bras.
> 
> As the two talked, the normally jovial Burlington High School student shared that they were scared of a man named “Lumni.” They said they’d noticed a mysterious red car following them that day. They weren't sure who was behind the wheel or where the vehicle was as they spoke. 
> 
> Kedarie didn’t stay long at their friend’s house. They asked to borrow a few of the bras they’d modeled, and the friend, 15 at the time, obliged. Kedarie tucked the undergarments into their black and blue school backpack and braced against the biting wind as they walked into the night alone.
> 
> Their quick exchange was one of the last times Kedarie Johnson was seen alive.

In November 2017 a jury in Keokuk, Iowa, convicted Jorge ""Lumni"" Sanders-Galvez, 23, of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Ten months later Jaron Purham, 26 (who was arrested near St. Louis about two weeks after the murder driving the same red Chevrolet Impala that picked up Johnson, with the murder weapon on the floor of the driver's side seat) was also found guilty of first-degree murder. He also faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

> According to Anita Nelson, the Chief Executive of SRO Housing Corporation,who identified Yochum to the Times, Yochum was walking her two dogs when the alleged gunman walked up to her and shot her. After the shooting, the suspect was taken into police custody. Nelson told the Times, “It is mind-boggling; it happened in the open. I’m heartbroken. Our residents are traumatized, our staff is traumatized.” She added that “Everybody loved her. She was very popular.”

In December 2017 Daniel Molayem, 39, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison.

> Yochum’s friend Megan Lacy Wren addressed Molayem in court, telling him, “When the coroner called me to verify she had been killed, I  already knew you were the one who did it as she would express her fear of you killing her,” City News reported.

> Several local media reports on Successful’s death misgendered the victim, identifying her with male pronouns and a masculine name. A follow-up report published Tuesday by Lakeland newspaper The Ledger includes quotes from Successful’s friends confirming that she had recently begun a clinical transition to live full-time as her authentic self, but the article wholly avoids pronouns and uses the late performer’s given name to identify her throughout. In addition to needlessly noting that Successful was “not dressed like a woman when found,” the Ledger article indicates that police are not currently investigating the murder as a hate crime.

She was ignored by doctors and refused access to either the male or female wards following complaints from staff and patients. She died of her injuries on Wednesday morning.

Alisha was the Peshawar coordinator and one of eight board members of Trans Action Alliance, an advocacy group that has been increasingly vocal in seeking equal rights for transgender people in the province.

In Facebook posts, Trans Action said the gang that shot Alesha specifically targets members of the transgender community, and sometimes sexually assaults them while recording the crime.

> For an hour, while Alesha bled, doctors couldn't decide whether to admit her to the men's or women's ward, according to Trans Action. When they finally decided on the men's ward, Trans Action protested, and had her moved to the women's ward, where other women apparently complained.
> 
> Then the taunts began, Trans Action said. One doctor allegedly asked a Trans Action volunteer for her telephone number and how much she charges for a dancing party. Another was reportedly asked if her breasts were real. Another asked if the women from Trans Action just danced or also ""perform sex,"" according to the group.

She had been heading to a friend's party in a borrowed car on the night she was killed. According to the medical examiner, she died of blunt force trauma before the car was set alight.

> Rest in power, Goddess Diamond. Her chosen first name is not yet known, so the Advocate.com reports that Venus Selenite, a black trans feminine artist, coined the name Goddess for Diamond so that Goddess would not be referred to by her birth name in stories about her death.
> 
> We see you, Goddess. We say your name.

> Diamond had recently moved back to the area and was working at a Wal-Mart in the French Quarter. She was loved by her friends and family.
> 
> “When I asked her if she identified as a man or a woman, she told me that she would answer to both. But being that she was transitioning, I felt that it was the best to refer to her as a woman, and she agreed,” her co-worker, George Melichar, told The New Orleans Advocate. She “was very loved, and was very kind,” Melichar said. “And that’s what makes this more difficult. In addition to losing a friend, we lost an LGBT leader.”

She had travelled to the town to attend the Gulf Coast Black Rodeo (GCBR) rodeo with friends.

Two days after she was killed, a 20-year-old Navy seaman in training named Dwanya Hickerson was charged with capital murder for the crime. In July 2017 he was sentanced to 40 years for murder and 15 for robbery.

> For the last several years, the media has tracked the murders of transgender women in the United States. Since its creation last summer, Broadly has followed these crimes. There are several common threads that run throughout the killings of transgender women. The killers are nearly always men, the crimes often happen in the context of a sexual or romantic relationship, and the degree of violence perpetrated on their victims is extreme. For instance, running someone over and over with a truck, or stabbing someone 119 times. In December of 2015, Broadly asked the acclaimed gender theorist Judith Butler what the extreme nature of this violence might indicate. This was her reply:
> 
> ""It indicates that we are all living in a society in which such hideous and horrible things happen, and that there is nowhere near enough media attention paid to such matters. In fact, the popular media deflects from this aspect of trans existence when it should be raising our awareness and helping us to organize a systematic resistance to such violence. Perhaps the man who drives over the trans woman time and again cannot quite make her dead enough. At a certain point, she is already dead, but he is not finished killing her. Why? It is because he wants to obliterate any trace of his own relation to that living person, obliterating a part of himself and living person at the same time. But also establishing his absolute power, and his own masculinity as the site of that power. Perhaps he is rebuilding his gender as he continues to try to take apart and efface that trans woman who never deserved to die. He is seeking as well to establish a world in which no one like her exists.""

On 12th August her body was found at the side of a road in the Zekeriyaköy neighborhood of Istanbul. She had been raped, mutilated, and burnt.

She was last seen getting into a car with a client and had been missing for several days before her body was discovered.

> Ms Kader, a sex worker, was last seen entering a client's car one night. Mr Dengiler had hoped she was still alive but he found her body in Istanbul's morgue for unidentified persons.
> 
> ""I was about to leave the morgue. I felt a sense of lightness for not having found her there. At the last minute, a doctor there said, 'There's also a burned body - look at that as well.' I did. I told them identifying features. They then looked at the computer, at the report. The doctor put his hand on my back and gave his condolences. I lost myself,"" he said.
> 
> He explained Ms Kader's reaction to the deaths of other trans people: ""She would go crazy when trans individuals were killed. She'd be so sad... She had been stabbed and beaten before. This didn't happen only to Hande. It happens to all of them.""

News of her murder led to a protest in Istanbul on 21th August, despite police repression against public gatherings. Protesters chanted slogans and demanded justice, holding banners reading “We want to die of natural causes”.

> But it is perhaps the images of Hande Kader that have been shared innumerable times on social media that best explain the trans woman who is still waiting to be buried due to the processes of identification, post mortem, and DNA testing.
> 
> In 2015, police had banned the annual LGBTI Pride march in Taksim Square in Istanbul. They tried to disperse the crowds, using water cannon, rubber bullets and pepper spray. But Ms Kader stood stubbornly against the police.
> 
> She reproached journalists: ""You take pictures but you do not publish them. No-one is hearing our voices.""
> 
> Hande Kader's voice was silenced finally by murder, in a way no one would want to imagine: she was burned.

> Dealing with murders is not for anyone. But there is a big difference between seeing a dead person and a dying person. 
> 
> And that's what happened in front of a dozen people around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday (15), in General Jardim street, central region of São Paulo, witnessing a trans woman shot on the sidewalk with a bullet mark on the abdomen, from which flowed a thread of blood that flowed into the ditch.
> 
> Shots were heard. Two blocks away, a car and a few police officers were standing. But the sound did not get there. Around the body, about five people. One young man reported that he saw the victim being thrown out of a gray, gray Fox model car. In fright, he ran, along with a lady. On her return, Larissa lay alternating the movement of her breast between weak sighs and others that were like trying to get back to life.
> 
> When her chest did not move for a long time, the people next to her chanted her name and pleaded, ""Larissa, breathe."" And she responded with a deep sigh, but clearly the result of a massive effort.
> 
> Police. Firemen. Curious. Larissa.
> 
> A friend asked to pick up her phone and, according to her, to call her mother. The officer denies the request. The victim needs to breathe.
> 
> The area is secluded. Rescuers insist on cardiac massage and begin to apply some medicine in the region of the shot. Larissa's belly becomes swollen and continues to move in a superhuman movement, because of the pressure on the rib cage.
> 
> She will be rescued. A relief, for now. She's alive.
> 
> The girl was taken to the Hospital das Clínicas. To R7 , the hospital's press office reports that Larissa died at dawn on Friday (16). She succumbed to the violence to which her body was exposed. In the streets, as a trans woman, the victim was exposed daily to all kinds of violence, which only those who live in and on the streets know.
> 
> Larissa was the social name of a young trans woman who was born in Passos (MG). At 31 years of age and only a full first degree, the trans woman circulated through the downtown streets and made her hair in a salon in the area. There, a block from where she died.
> 
> Finding the culprit will not be easy. No one say the car numberplate. One resident of the fateful street commented that most of the security cameras in the area where Larissa was shot do not work.
> 
> The victim who was ""nothing,"" became a statistic in a country that reeks of violence against transgender women while pornographic videos with this category are preferred among Brazilians. Something of a questionable logic.

She had been shot in the back of the head.

She was taken to hospital but died a few hours later.

> To her family, Crystal was known by a few names. Because, as a child, she had a bump on her face, they called her Bumpkis, Bumpy, and then Bumpers. But mostly they called her Ms. Crystal. Now and then the family referred to her by her birth name, or as many in the trans community call it, her dead name. Deadnaming is the act of referring to a trans person by their birth name instead of their chosen name. Some of the family members also had an issue using Crystal's preferred pronouns. However, they spoke highly and honestly of her. You could see how fresh this trauma was on all of the family's faces. Any time Crystal's sister spoke of her, she would fight back tears.
> 
> ""Crystal was an incredible cook, but her specialty was baking,"" Ms. Vanessa said, grinning from ear to ear. ""She loved to bake. When holidays came she baked everything. I don't even want to think about the holidays this year. It's gonna be hard.""

Paola Ledezma González,23,NA,2016_09_30_Paola-Ledezma-Gonzalez.jpg,https://ulisex.com/la-vida-muerte-velorio-las-calles-paola-ledezma-obituario-transfeminicidio/,2016-09-30,30 Sep 2016/Paola Ledezma Gonzalez,Distrito Federal,Mexico,25.859417,-99.941748,shot,"Paola was shot twice after climbing into a client's car on the night of Friday 30th September. She died almost instantly.

> ""This guy arrived and it looked like he was drugged and drunk, and my friend got up to give him the service, but the car did not go seven meters when he shot her twice and killed her.""
> 
> ""I began to scream desperately, and in that instant a patrol passed and stopped him while he was still inside the car,"" he said.

Her companions tried to come to her aid and managed to stop the car with the help of the crew of a police patrol. Although her killer was arrested, 48 hours later he was released on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to link him to the homicide process.

Paola's body was delivered to her friends on Sunday, before taking her to a funeral home.

> A couple of hours later the remains of Paola arrived at the wake, there she spent the night between prayers and tears of her acquaintances. Her funeral was a luxury, the cost exceeded 25 thousand pesos for the ward, the coffee service, advice on paperwork, transfer, embalming, makeup and burial in the Civil Pantheon of San Lorenzo Tezonco in Iztapalapa.
> 
> ""In order to pay for the funeral, girls from different areas cooperated: de la Merced, Sullivan, Insurgentes, Puente de Alvarado and even Tlalpan. You see a few here but there are many who supported with something, they can be whores ... but not culeras"", explained Adriana Barrios Ruiz who had rented to Paola for more than a year a small room where she lived in the street of Doctor Enrique González Martínez and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in the Doctores colony.
